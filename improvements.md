# Personal Website Improvements

Based on a comprehensive review of the current Next.js personal website, here are the top 5 improvements that would significantly enhance the site:

## 1. Content Personalization and Branding
**Priority: High** 游댮

- Replace all placeholder content ("Your Name", "[Your Profession]", etc.) with actual personal information
- Fix the broken profile image (`/placeholder.svg`) and add a real photo with proper optimization
- Update metadata in `app/layout.tsx` to include personal title, description, and keywords for SEO
- Replace placeholder social media links with real profile URLs
- Add a custom favicon to replace the default Next.js icon

*Current issue: The entire site uses placeholder content making it non-functional for actual use.*

## 2. Dark Mode Implementation
**Priority: Medium** 游리

- Add a theme toggle component to switch between light and dark modes
- The dark mode CSS is already configured in `app/globals.css` but not accessible to users
- Implement theme persistence using localStorage or `next-themes`
- Add smooth transitions between theme switches
- Ensure the retro aesthetic works well in both light and dark modes

*Current issue: Dark mode styling exists but there's no way for users to toggle it.*

## 3. Enhanced Content Sections
**Priority: Medium** 游리

- Expand beyond the single card layout to include multiple sections:
  - About/Bio section with more detailed information
  - Projects showcase with GitHub repository links
  - Skills or technologies section
  - Contact information or simple contact form
- Keep the retro theme consistent across all new sections
- Maintain the single-page layout with smooth scrolling between sections

*Current issue: Very limited content makes the site feel incomplete and unprofessional.*

## 4. Performance and SEO Optimization
**Priority: Medium** 游리

- Replace regular `<img>` tags with Next.js `Image` component for optimization
- Add proper Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- Configure image domains in `next.config.ts` for external images
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) for better search engine understanding
- Update the generic README.md with project-specific information

*Current issue: Missing modern web performance and SEO best practices.*

## 5. Subtle Interactive Enhancements
**Priority: Low** 游릭

- Add gentle animations and micro-interactions that complement the retro theme
- Implement a typing animation for the bio/profession text
- Add loading states and hover effects for better user feedback
- Include smooth scrolling between sections (if multiple sections are added)
- Consider adding a subtle background pattern or texture to enhance the retro aesthetic

*Current issue: Static design lacks engaging interactive elements that would make the site more memorable.*

## Implementation Notes

- **Keep it simple**: Since this is a single-page personal website, avoid over-engineering
- **Maintain the retro theme**: The current amber/stone color scheme and retro styling work well
- **Mobile-first**: The current responsive design is good, maintain this approach
- **Accessibility**: Current accessibility practices are solid, continue following these patterns

## Quick Wins

Start with **Improvement #1** as it requires no new features, just content replacement, and will immediately make the site functional and professional.
